# Recipe Builder
This program provides an interface for producing recipe cards.
A recipe consists of a title, a list of ingredients, and a list of instructions.
The output for a recipe card comes in the form of a downloadable HTML file.

I want to extend this in the future to a more comprehensive interface :)
