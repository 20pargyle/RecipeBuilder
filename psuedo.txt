HTML
```
    recipe title input

    ingredient section
        ingredient text input
        "add ingredient" button
        ingredient list div
            each ingredient, with a button to delete attached (p.s. will need a way to identify the whole div element to delete it)
        
    instruction section
        instruction text input (with 4/5 flex space) "add instruction" button (with 1/5 flex space)
        instruction step list div
            each step, with a button to delete attached (p.s. will need a way to identify the whole div element to delete it) (and a number for order [STRETCH w/ git branch])

    "reset" button (describedBy = the text)
    "export recipe" button (describedBy = the text) (both buttons justified right, taking collectively 1/3 of the div space)
```

CSS
    the "add ingredient / instruction button has an ARIA tag of submit (?)
    ARIA tags to refer to individual list item divs.
    the instruction / ingredient div is a flex-box, containing all elements, extending the body to scroll if there is overflow.
    each list item div (generalized for both instructions AND ingredients) is a flex-box, text positioned at flex-start, button positioned at flex-end

JS.... lots of it
    "add [item]" button takes the innerHTML of the input field and populates a new div (that includes "delete" button) with the text.

    each button: able to be "clicked" with the enter key when focused
    reset button: sets every input's innerHTML to "" AND deletes *all* list item divs.
    "export recipe" button makes a recipe object (that fits the requirements of the "whiteRecipeToFile.js" script) and passes it to that .js file.


Problems I'm encountering along the way:
    - The ability to delete a list item is unclear to the user (especially for accessibility)
        - how to read / listen to the lists without deleting them
    - recipe title input not centered
